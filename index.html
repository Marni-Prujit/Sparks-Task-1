        <p id="p1">Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply
            rewarding
            for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as
            well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.</p>
        <p id="p2"><br>Donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that youâ€™re helping others is hugely
            empowering
            and, in turn, can make you feel happier and more fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a
            donation to charity and increased activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure - proving that
            as the old adage goes, it really is far better to give than to receive.</p>
        <p id="p3"><br>Sharing the experience of donating to charity with your children shows them from a young age that
            they
            can make positive changes in the world. Children naturally love to help others, so nurturing their innate
            generosity is likely to mean that they grow up with a greater appreciation of what they have, and will
            carry on supporting charity in years to come.</p>
        <p id="p4"><br>Your own charitable donations can inspire your nearest and dearest to give to causes important to
            them,
            and could even bring about a family-wide effort to back a charity or charities that have special
            significance to you as a group.</p><br><br>
